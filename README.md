# MI0283QT2_micropython_lvgl

This project offers a driver implementation for the MI0283QT2 display.

There are 2 files one for the basic driver that uses a framebuffer to draw, and another that uses lvgl library. For the use of lvgl there is 
an example in the example folder.

Here is a video of the lvgl example in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzA-noMw8y4
